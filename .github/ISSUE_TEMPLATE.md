<!--
The following template is useful for creating new issues. Processing an issue will go much faster when this is filled out, and issues which do not use this template WILL BE REMOVED.

Before creating, PLEASE check if the issue already exists (either open or closed) by using the search bar on the issues page. If it does, comment there. Even if it's closed, we can reopen it based on your comment.

Also, please note the library version in the title of the issue. For example: "[0.1.0] No signal over TCP". Please do not write things like "Request:" or "[BUG]" in the title; this is what labels are for.

It is also helpful to include the full Arduino sketch in code brackets so we can debug issues quicker.

Thank you!
